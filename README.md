#MBSet
=====
This application uses the NVIDIA CUDA library to generate a Mandlebrot set quickly and efficiently using high performace graphics cards. Data is copied from the computer to the graphics card via an array. Calculations are performed, and then the data is copied back to the computer and displayed graphicall using OpenGL. Colors are generated by converting hue (0 - 360) to RGB values that are mapped to the number of iterations performed.

##Requirements:
=====
This application requires a CUDA compatible NVIDIA graphics card and CUDA 4.0 installed. It was also written on OSX 10.8.3 and tested on a Linux cluster.

##Compile:
=====
1. Edit the Makefile and change the path to your CUDA installation
2. Run:
```
make
```

##Usage:
=====

Run (exports CUDA library to path on run):
```
sh runMBSet.sh
```
